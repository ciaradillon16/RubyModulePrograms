Hi Ciara, 
Congratulations you're in! Welcome to the group: this is going to be fun and easy. Here are some tips about what to expect and what you can do. 
How It Works 
An Elfster exchange is a gifting game where participants are randomly assigned to one another. Each person anonymously gives and receives a gift. You'll find out who you're giving to after the sign up deadline. Plus there are lots of fun ways to socialize with everyone in your group along the way. 
Socialize 
You can post a message to your group any time, and you can comment on and like any of the activity from your friends. 
Wish 
Add stuff to your wish list to give your person some hints. You can also follow any of the wishlists of your friends and family even if they aren't the ones you are buying for in the gift exchange. Stay in touch and see what your friends love! 
Discover 
You can browse trending gifts to see what other people have recently wished for. The lists are curated by the community to highlight fun and interesting stuff. Your wishes might find their way on to the list of recent discoveries! 
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. We are here to help and hope you have a great time.
